- name: copy multiple files from a location in ansible server to another location on the server
  hosts: test
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: copying files
      copy:
	    src: "{{ item.src }}"
		dest: "{{  item.dest }}"
		owner: root
		group: root
		mode: 644
	   with_items:
	      - { src: '<absolute path to source file 1>' , dest: '<absolute path to destination file 1>' }

- name: copy files

  tasks:
    - name: copy files task
      copy:
        src: "{{ item.src }}"
        dest: "{{ item.dest  }}"
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: 0644
      with_items:
        - src: hosts
          dest: /tmp
		  
the above playbook copies file name with hosts from ansible machine to remote machine but if we want to copy a file from one place in remote machine to another place in remote machine then use remote_src: yes
